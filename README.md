# DVO Profile

# What is this?

# It's a free CV! You can view a live demo <a href="https://dvo.github.io/profile/">here</a>

<p>The CV is stored as an XML file, although I will probably switch to JSON-LD. By ensuring that all data is stored and accessed in a standardized way, employers can search for potential employees, without the need for a middle man. As it currently stands, the XML file is read-only. However, I plan to introduce a browser plugin that will allow users to connect to their hosting provider and manage their data (and webmail) remotely. Why? Because then we can build powerful applications on top of this data, without locking the user into any specific platform.</p>

<p>Over time I will introduce new features. For example, I will provide users with a way to add posts (RSS/Atom feeds), which other users can subscribe to. They will be able read their posts in the NEWS section. Also, using the browser plugin you can like, dislike and comment on any URL.</p>

<p>This application can also be used for online dating, and many other things. However, the ultimate goal of DVO (short for "Devolution") is to provide communities with the tools they need to effectively govern themselves. These tools will include everything from communitiy currencies, voting sytems, crowdfunding, ratings and reviews, course builders, and will even include a modular housing system built using aluminium profile. As soon as we have control over our data, and make our data publicly accessible, the sky is the limit.</p>
